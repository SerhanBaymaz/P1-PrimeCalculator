Project 1: Windows Desktop Application in C#

Description:

Develop a Windows Forms desktop application in C# with the following UI elements:

- Two textboxes (for user input)
- Two buttons (to trigger prime number calculations)
- Two listboxes (to display results separately)

Functionality:

1. The user enters a number in Textbox 1, then clicks Button 1 (Calculate 1).
   - The application finds all prime numbers up to the entered number.
   - The computation must run in a separate thread.
   - The results should be displayed in ListBox 1.

2. The user enters a number in Textbox 2, then clicks Button 2 (Calculate 2).
   - The application finds all prime numbers up to the entered number.
   - The computation must run in a separate thread.
   - The results should be displayed in ListBox 2.

Both calculation buttons should be able to run at the same time without blocking each other or the UI.
